    the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign 
    studying Computer Science and Chemsitry with 
    interests in Computational Modelling, Machine 
    Learning and IoT among others. I'm particularly involved with research here on campus, as well as a few resident student organizations
    . Right now, I am looking for Summer 2023 internships within software,
    and am excited and ready to contribute. Below is a little about what 
    I have done during my time here over the past few years.
